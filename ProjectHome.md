This will be a tool for measuring the distance between 2 cities that have hosted the olympic games.

Then we are going to give pupils pedometers to measure how far they have walked, then put that measure into the system to show how far they have progressed along the route, which they will be able to save.

Another aspect of this will be to save (or link) to videos on youtube, so that when a school has reached their destination, they do an olympic challenge, video it and upload it to youtube.

The technology created from this project, should then be available to anyone to run their on competitions.
